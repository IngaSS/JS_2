        my garden there is no red rose.' From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked
        out through the leaves, and wondered. 'No red rose in all my garden!' he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled
        with tears. 'Ah, fon what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written,
        and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.' 'Here at last
        is a true lover,' said the Nightingale. 'Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night
        after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and
        his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set
        her seal upon his brow.' 'The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,' murmured the young Student, 'and my love
        will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I
        shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.
        But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of
        me, and my heart will break.' 'Here indeed is the true lover,' said the Nightingale. 'What I sing of, he suffers
        - what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and
        dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may
        not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.'
